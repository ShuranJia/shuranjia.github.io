                            <p class="card-text">A game is played out between two teams, each made up of 9 players. The
                                game lasts for 9 innings with each team alternating between batting and fielding in each
                                inning. The scores at the end of the innings are added to a cumulative score and the
                                team with most points wins. Each team has three outs per inning before they then swap
                                roles. Each inning can be broken down into the top (where the away team bats), and the
                                bottom (where the home team bats).</p>

                            <p class="card-text"> The field is split into two sections: infield and outfield.
                                Separating the infield and outfield is a diamond shape with four bases, spaced at 90
                                feet apart each. In the center of the infield is the pitching mound where the pitcher
                                stands and throws the ball toward the batter. The batter stands at the home plate. The
                                other three bases are known as first base, second base and third base. The batter must
                                touch all bases before successfully scoring a run.</p>

                            <h5 class="card-title">Scoring Rules</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">To score, the batter must hit the ball with the bat into the designated
                                outfield area and p-run across four bases (before the outfield team can collect the ball
                                and throw it to the base the batter is running on). A player who hits a home run is
                                awarded a mandatory run, which usually means the ball has left the playing area. If a
                                player feels they may not reach the next base before being tagged out, they may stop at
                                either base.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">If more than one player is already on one of the bases, a player can
                                score multiple runs from a single at-bat. When you hear the term "bases loaded," this
                                means that there is a player on each base. Therefore, every time a batter hits the ball
                                successfully to first base, the other players on second and third base are able to run
                                the bases without incident, which earns them a run for their team. A maximum of 4 runs
                                can be scored on a single hit.</p>

                      <p class="card-text"><b>Stolen base: </b> runner on the base does not have to wait for the batter to hit the ball before running, but can run to the next base as soon as the pitcher throws the ball, which is called stealing.</p>
                      <p class="card-text"><b>Home run: </b>Simply put, the batter hits the baseball out of the field and no one can pick it up, so the offensive opponent is left to run the bases at will. Depending on the score, it can be divided into Yangchun home run (a home run with no one on the base and only one batter), two/three run home run (a home run hit by a batter with one/two people on the base), and slam home run (a home run hit by a batter when the bases are full).</p>
                      <p class="card-text"><b>Catch:</b> The batter hits the baseball, but the ball is caught by any player on the defensive side before it hits the ground. At this point, the runner is considered out regardless of whether he or she has reached base.</p>
                      <p class="card-text"> <b>Touchdown:</b> The defensive player with the ball touches the offensive player with his glove or hand. The runner is out after a successful touchdown.</p>
